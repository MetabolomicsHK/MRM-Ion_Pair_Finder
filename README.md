# MRM-Ion Pair Finder

## Introduction
Pseudotargeted metabolomics is a novel method that perform high coverage metabolome detection based on UHPLC-TQMS. MRM-Ion Pair Finder software is an independently developed and written program in our laboratory for large-scale selection of MRM transitions for pseudotargeted metabolomics. The Matlab (Version 7.14.739, R2012a,64-bit) is used. MRM-Ion Pair Finder v2.0 is improved on the basis of the original version, which simplifies the program and improves the running efficiency. Matlab language (R2018b, 64-bit) is used. To make MRM-Ion Pair Finder can be used by more researchers, we also provide a version based on R.

## Process 
The whole process of running the software is as follows: (1) Establish folders containing parent ion information (parent ion information from the results of XCMS and CAMERA) and product ion information (product ion information from MGF files). (2) Run MRM-Ion Pair Finder, automatically select ion pairs, output results.
